        <h1 style="color:mediumvioletred">The Instruments</h1>
          <p class="violet">In marching band, of course you're expected to see instruments. Without these instruments, it wouldn't even be a band. Lets go meet the different type of instruments.</p>
        <h2 style="color:deeppink">Meet The Instruments</h2>
          <p class="violet">All of the marching band instruments are part of a set or group of other related instruments. These people with those instruments can be put and classified into sections. In marhcing band, there are many sections. These sections include in: brass, woodwinds, and percussion.</p>
        <h3>Brass</h3>
          <p class="violet">The brass section consists of a mixture of high and low brass. High brass includes a mixture of trumpets and mellophones, which is basically a french horn made for marching. It plays and sounds like one, and it looks like a trumpet, except its bigger, especially its bell. Low brass typically include a mixture of baritones, tubas, and sousaphones. These are very big, heavy instruments that play really low notes and pitches. Here is a picture of all of these instruments.</p>

              <p class="violet">As there are no labels for the instruments, here they are in order from left to right.</p>

        <h3>Woodwinds</h3>
          <p class="violet">The woodwind section consists of a mixture of different type of woodwind instruments. These usually include in flutes, saxes, bass clarinets, and clarinets. Here are what they look like.</p>
            <img src="http://www.musixcool.com/members/musixcool/inst_all/woodwinds.jpg" alt="Some Woodwind Instruments">
              <p class="violet"> Some of these aren't always used by all bands and there are different types of saxophones that are used in marching band, but you get the idea. Well at least I hope you do.</p>
        <h3>Percussion</h3>
          <p class="violet">The percussion section can be split off into many depending on the type of percussion instruments there are. In most cases they are reffered to two different sections. This would be the front ensemble, which can also be called the pit, and the drumline.</p>
        <h4>The Front Ensemble</h4>
          <p class="violet">The front ensemble, or pit, is the stationary percussion ensemble. This ensemble is typically placed in front of the football field. They include instruments such as mallet instruments, cymbals, electronics, and accessories. Mallet instruments include in marimbas, xylophone, and vibraphones. Cymbals include in suspended cymbals and crash cymbals. Electronics include in electric guitars and bass, synthesizer, and sometimes other electronical instruments. Accessories include in congas, bongos, claves, cowbells, bass drums, gongs, and pretty much anything that is not a mallet or electrical instrument. This is what a front ensemble looks like.</p>

        <h4>The Drumline</h4>
          <p class="violet">The batterie drumline is a section that marches on the field as a group. The batterie usually consists of snare drums, bass drums, tenor drums, and cymbals, but cymbals are rare, I haven't seen any march in person. Here are what the drums look like.</p>

          <p class="violet">On the left, there are the bass drums. In the middle there is a tenor drum. To the right of him, there are snare drums. Finally, all the way on the right, there is a cymbal.</p>
