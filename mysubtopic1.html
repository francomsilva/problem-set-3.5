            <h3 style="color:darkblue">So Is It a Sport?</h3>
            <p>Most people don't think marching band is a sport. Technically, this extra curricular activity can be considered a sport. Marching band can be considered sport because just like any other sport, it invovles physical activity and exertion, involves skill, and competes against others while entertaining at the same time. Not just that, but just like any other sports team, marching bands have rehersals for hours and hours. All usually participate in band camp, which is specified to work on music (show music and stand music, which are played in the stands of football games), work on the basics of marching, play while marching, and learn drill for shows and competitions. Practice makes perfect !! </p>
