        <h1 style="color:green">The Events</h1>
          <p class="springgreen">In marching band, there are many different events that they can particpate in. These events include in football games, competitions, and parades.</p>
        <h2 style="color:forestgreen">Football Games</h2>
          <p class="springgreen">In football games, marching bands sometimes perform their show during pre-game or during half-time. It usually depends who plays home and who plays away. It also depends whether or not the band wants to perform during those times. There were times were my marching band didn't perform at all during any of these times, I really don't know why though. Besides performing their shows, marching bands also play stand music, or stand tunes, which means they play these tunes while on the football stands.</p>
        <h2 style="color:forestgreen">Competitions</h2>
          <p class="springgreen">In competitions. marching bands compete against other marching bands while performing their show for entertainment. These marching bands get scored on categories such as their music, marching technique, visual, and color guard. There's this marching band, but instead of it being a bunch of different wind instruments involved, it's all brass instruments. These are called Drum Corps or Drum and Bugle Corps. These have two different types of competiton classes, which are DCI and DCA. Not too much detail into these, but their competitions are harder and more challenging than your average high school or college marching band. Here are the scores of the DCI World Championship Prelims that took place in Indianapolis, IN.</p>

            <h2 style="color:forestgreen">Parades</h2>
              <p class="springgreen">Typically, during parades, marching bands march in a parade block and play some of the assigned stand tunes that they play at football games. This is done on the street so people can see and enjoy as entertainment. Here is what a marching band parade block looks like.</p>
